So this is my first log in my LIFE.
What happend today? 
well normal day except we have pizza. Oh and chicken wings.
the pizza I THINK is still hot, but who knows.
So I also had a bubble bath well only a bath with blueberry bath salts.

Today I asked my mom if she could say yes to everything me and my brother said for 24hrs.
On saterday and she said yes. Oh boy do I have a lot of things to do in that day. She also set up 
a reservation for the indoor pool so Im really looking forward to that.

So I woke up at 9:02 A.M to go to my mom and dads room to
relax and leave the bed at 10:00. After that my mom made me
spell a bunch of words because a didn't know how to spell signature.
After that, after I had dinner I noticed that there was no juice
so I made a berry smoothie. With this: Frozen berrys, ice cream, milk, and whipped cream.
